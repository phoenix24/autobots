h3. PostBot

The PostBot is like a post master, you can make HTTP POST / GET / PUT / DELETE using it
and have the posted data relayed anywhere (xmpp/email), to anyone. :P

Post-Bot is basically a webhook service.


h3. How to use it ?

Every new user needs to subscribe to the service initially at, 

bq. "http://post-bot.3bandar.org(post bot)":http://post-bot.3bandar.org

upon which it sends 

bq. a _confirmation email_
    an _invitation_ to your xmpp chat (gtalk) account


h3. Todos,

# add support for HTTP GET.
# add support for HTTP PUT.
# add support for HTTP DELETE.
# pass the userid; service type (email/xmpp) as part of the POST data or the GET data (absolutely debatable; need to think over.)
# keep a count of the messages sent.
# Post-Bot, data should be viewable on the web-page aswell; for introspection you see. 
# Post-Bot, also generate a short-url for each posted-data; (and return it against each post) so that can be used as a bin; send over a commandline; app; service; etc.
