h3. AutoBots

A family of interactive bots, based to chat/interact on xmpp protocol.
I tried make each one of these of a simple, 'create-your-bot' type framework but that is still to be done.
 


h2. GithubBot

The GithubBot listens to the commits made to a particular github repository, 
and spews the alerts to a given user on his xmpp (gtalk) account.

GithubBot is basically a webhook service.


h2. HelpBot

The HelpBot is an interactive help bot, still under construction :D.
please come back soon!

HelpBot is basically a webhook service.


h2. PostBot

The PostBot is like a post master, you can make HTTP POST / GET / PUT / DELETE using it
and have the posted data relayed anywhere (xmpp/email), to anyone. :P

Post-Bot is basically a webhook service.


h2. Todo-Bots

This is a simple app that allows create and manage your todo's for various projects; and hopefully across a bunch of devices aswell.




h3. How to use it these bots ?

Every new user needs to subscribe to the service initially at, 

bq. "http://github-bot.3bandar.org(github bot)":http://github-bot.3bandar.org

upon which it sends 

bq. a _confirmation email_
    an _invitation to your xmpp chat (gtalk) account_
