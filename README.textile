h3. AutoBots

A family of interactive bots, based to chat/interact on xmpp protocol.
I tried make each one of these of a simple, 'create-your-bot' type framework but that is still to be done.
 


h2. GithubBot

The GithubBot listens to the commits made to a particular github repository, 
and spews the alerts to a given user on his xmpp (gtalk) account.

GithubBot is basically a webhook service.

h3. How to use it these bots ?

Every new user needs to subscribe to the service initially at, 

bq. "http://github-bot.3bandar.org(github bot)":http://github-bot.3bandar.org

upon which it sends 

bq. a _confirmation email_
    an _invitation to your xmpp chat (gtalk) account_
